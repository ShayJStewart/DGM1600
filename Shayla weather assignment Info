Because of the time constraint I have with going out of town  on friday, I will be commiting the weather every 30-60 minutes for Orem UT

most of them will be 60 minutes in between each

I'm starting to understand how to do commits, it's pretty cool

I have to get this done by Thursday night along with several assignments, that is why I keep adding different files and text documents to practice committing 


I will be using the Iphone Weather App for this assignment


This GitHub is a lot easier to understand than git Kraken. I know right where to press to commit something and how to commit it nad write the
commit message. Git Kraken I have no clue how to upload the files or how to commit them
